# Real world Evolutionary Design with python

## Session type

Hands-on workshop (2h - 3h)

## In brief (pitch)

Do you struggle to build a flexible working software without any big upfront design?

Do you have fun with code katas but you feel you need more to tackle real world design problems?

During this workshop, we will create a software using Python and following different Evolutionary Design techniques. Thanks to this exercice, we will see how _Outside-in TDD by wishful thinking_ can help emerging design and keep us focused on the value to deliver.

## In full

This session introduces Evolutionary Design through the implementation of a user story. We will follow the outside-in approach of Test Driven Development, which will guide our implementation towards user interaction with the software. 

The aim is to write just enough well crafted code to meet the user story, while minimizing any accidental complexity.

By following the steps of "programming by wishful thinking", we will be able to understand how we can isolate domain logic from infra.

After that, we will see how to address non functional concerns on a "working" software.

Moreover, this session will show that Python is not only a good programming language for scripting or data science notebook reports. It is also a valid programming language to build real world softwares.
