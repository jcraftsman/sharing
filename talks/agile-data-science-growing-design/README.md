# Agile data science: growing software design from data exploration to user adoption

## Abstract

Everybody is deeply convinced that AI, as well as Big data and IoT, can actually be real game changers. Many actors have sprung in the business and the startups betting on it have become "unicorns".
Last year I moved to the Silicon Valley. My client, a global energy company, developed a partnership with a startup providing a platform for Big Data analytics and AI.

In this session, I will share my experiences about agile data science software development.
It's a focus on data science over the business value discovery and the product delivery.
We will see the difference between having a potential for data science and finding the very business value that can be brought.
Once the value has been located, the transition from the study to the product can start.
The challenge is to understand how to steadily deliver value while working in an exploratory business domain. And, in such an uncertain domain, the product vision is even more blurred than usual.

In the first part, I will share some insights to design for a continuous change within an emerging domain.
Also, we will see that software design is not enough to support this. What we need is :

- To collaborate effectively between different areas of expertise (Data Science, Data Integration, App Development)
- To promote the learning path of the team

The second part of this talk will be a live coding session to refactor a python notebook (used for exploration) into cloud ready applications.

## Hands-on

# Agile data science: growing software design by refactoring

A data science project starts with exploration.
Python notebook are by far the most popular tool for this activity today.

We will start this session by having a look to a "realistic" exploration study that comes in the form of python notebook.
We will try to understand all the pipelines and transformations it contains.

After that, we will try to locate the different bounded contexts.
Then, we will focus on one bunded context and try to describe the outcome of the exploration study by writing a suite of tests. Here, we will see some techniques to test non deterministic behaviours and to decompose complexity resulting of large dataset manipulation.

Then, we will refactor some code snippets (that come from the notebook) into clean modules and use them to create a cloud ready REST API.

It is not required to be a python expert nor a data scientist to attend this hands-on. You will be provided with detailed step-by-step instructions in order to promote interaction during this workshop.

So, if you want to:

- Discover what data science exploration looks like
- Have an insight of machine learning code
- Discover python programming language
- Test in python
- Discover some refactoring techniques
- Understand how to make a design emerge from working code snippets

This hands-on session is for you!
