# Dances with _unicorns_

## Approach

This talk is about agile datascience.
It's a focus on datascience over the business value discovery and the product delivery.

At first, we will see the difference between having a potential for datascience and finding the very business value that can be brought.

Once the value has been located, the transition from the study to the product can start. The challenge is to understand how to steadily deliver value while working in an exploratory environment. To do so, I will share some insights about how to:

- Collaborate effectively between 3 areas of expertise (Data Science, Data Integration, App Development), and avoid splitting them up
- Promote the learning path of the team
- Strengthen the collective ownership of the code
- Improve product quality in an exploratory field

To conclude, the aim of this session is to break the myth of unicorns and understand that having a platform and big data is not enough to succeed.

Please feel free to get back to me should you have any other question.
