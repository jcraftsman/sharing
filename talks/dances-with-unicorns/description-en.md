# Dances with _unicorns_

## Session type

Talk (45 min)

## In brief (pitch)

2017 was the year of AI. Everybody is deeply convinced that AI, as well as Big data and IoT, can actually be real game changers. Many actors have sprung in the business and the startups betting on it have become "unicorns".

2017 was the year I moved to the Silicon Valley. My client, a global energy company, developed a partnership with a startup providing a platform for Big Data analytics and AI.

During this talk, I will share the insights of this adventure. Several projects have been delivered. The challenge was to understand how to steadily deliver value while working in an exploratory environment (because of the platform maturity, but also the very nature of data science activities).

## In full

This talk is a feedback on the daily life of the project teams.

We will see how to:

- Integrate data science in an Agile project
- Collaborate effectively between 3 areas of expertise (Data Science, Data Integration, App Development), and avoid splitting them up
- Promote the learning path of the team
- Work with an unstable PAAS solution
- Strengthen the collective ownership of the code
- Improve product quality in an exploratory field

We will try to understand what worked well, but also the pain points.
Then, we will focus on how to collaborate with an editor when it is necessary to move forward in agile mode.
