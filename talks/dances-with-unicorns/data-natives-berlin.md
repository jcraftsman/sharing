# Dances with unicorns: Agile data science from exploration to adoption

## Abstract

Everybody is deeply convinced that AI, as well as Big data and IoT, can actually be real game changers. Many actors have sprung in the business and the startups betting on it have become "unicorns".

Last year I moved to the Silicon Valley. My client, a global energy company, developed a partnership with a startup providing a platform for Big Data analytics and AI.

During this talk, I will share the insights of this adventure. Several projects have been delivered. The challenge was to understand how to steadily deliver value while working in an exploratory environment (because of the platform maturity, but also the very nature of data science activities).

## In full

In this session, I will share my experiences about agile data science. 
It's a focus on data science over the business value discovery and the product delivery.

At first, we will see the difference between having a potential for data science and finding the very business value that can be brought.

Once the value has been located, the transition from the study to the product can start. The challenge is to understand how to steadily deliver value while working in an exploratory environment. To do so, I will share some insights about how to:

- Collaborate effectively between 3 areas of expertise (Data Science, Data Integration, App Development), and avoid splitting them up
- Promote the learning path of the team
- Strengthen the collective ownership of the code
- Improve product quality in an exploratory field

To conclude, the aim of this session is to break the myth of unicorns and understand that having a platform and big data is not enough to succeed.

Please feel free to get back to me should you have any other question.

I have already presented this talk at "Agile France" conference this year.

Nevertheless, I'm planning to make a few adjustments to that.
